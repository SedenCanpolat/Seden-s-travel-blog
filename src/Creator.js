            <h2> <span className="hello">Hello</span>, I'm the creator of this travel blog!</h2>
            <p>My name is Seden, I'm 22 years old and love travelling!
                 I'm a computer engineering student, and I try to create time for myself go,
                  see and try different things. I did this blog meanwhile, 
                  studying react as myself in the summer holiday, also thought 
                  it would be good to share my experiences and opinions. 
                  Thank you for reading and accompanying me with these adventures.
